            <p> Proteins are large biomolecules and macromolecules that comprise one or 
                more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array 
                of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, 
                DNA replication, responding to stimuli, providing structure to cells 
                and organisms, and transporting molecules from one location to another. 
                Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino 
                acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, 
                and which usually results in protein folding into a specific 3D 
                structure that determines its activity.</p>

            <p> A linear chain of amino acid residues is called a polypeptide. A protein 
                contains at least one long polypeptide. Short polypeptides, containing 
                less than 20–30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are 
                commonly called peptides, or sometimes oligopeptides. The individual 
                amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent 
                amino acid residues. The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein is 
                defined by the sequence of a gene, which is encoded in the genetic code. 
                In general, the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids; but in 
                certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and—in 
                certain archaea—pyrrolysine. Shortly after or even during synthesis, the 
                residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational 
                modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, 
                stability, activity, and ultimately, the function of the proteins. Some 
                proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic 
                groups or cofactors. Proteins can also work together to achieve a 
                particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein 
                complexes.</p>
